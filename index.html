        A feature of living with an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is having to trick them to achieve a
        certain outcome. As "users" of "products" we have no control over how the device operates. We can only control the
        inputs the developers give us access too. In many cases, a person who is pump dependent will provide false information
        to the pump in order to achieve a desired outcome.

        These self portraits were made in a similar way. Knowing how the lidar sensor and iphone app captured the environment, I
        developed a technique to reliably capture myself and create error.

        Me, over time, in space. Myself captured and converted to data. At this point - this feels right...
